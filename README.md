# 529-p2
Naive Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression implementation in C++

# Naive Bayes Classifier
## Compilation:
To compile the project, run  
``` bash
make N/A
```

## Prediction
To train and predict after compiling the project, run:  
``` bash
N/A
```

## Options for hyperparameters
N/A

## Optimal Configuration for data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning
Run the following code for optimal results.  
Note: It is assumed that the input train and test datasets have been preprocessed <Insert Pre-processing steps. It is also assumed that the file contains headers and that the target column is the last column.  
``` bash
N/A
```
